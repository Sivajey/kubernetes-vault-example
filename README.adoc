== Introduction

In this example, one will walk through the steps necessary to transform an
insecure web application — one that stores sensitive information, like credentials,
in the code itself and does not use TLS — into a secure application that uses Vault
for the management of secrets and TLS certificates.

The application used as an example is a simple HTTP _time server_ that
responds to `GET /` requests with the current date and time.

[#img-overview]
.Overview of the application.
image::overview.png[Overview of the application.,50%]

The goals of this example are to:
* Replace hardcoded credentials with a secret stored in Vault, and
* Replace HTTP basic authentication with mutual TLS authentication,
establishing TLS-secured communications as a result.

== Pre-Requisites

* A GKE cluster running Kubernetes *_v1.8.1_* or higher.
* The `kubectl` binary and proper configuration in order to access this cluster.
* A deployment of Vault configured as described in the https://github.com/travelaudience/kubernetes-vault[`kubernetes-vault documentation`].
* It is assumed that:
** Vault is reachable at https://vault.example.com.
** An instance of the
   https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/kubernetes.html[Kubernetes authentication backend]
   has been mounted as `kubeauth` and is properly configured to access to the
   abovementioned cluster.
** Two instances of the
   https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/pki/index.html[PKI secret backend]
   have been mounted as `root-ca` and `intermediate-ca`.
* The `vault` binary and a Vault root token for provisioning Vault are available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For the sake of clarity and completeness one will be provisioning Vault as one
progresses through the example. However, in a real-world scenario Vault should
be provisioned by an authorized operator instead of a developer. In that
scenario the last requirement can be dropped.
====

== Initial Example

The code for the initial examples lives in the `01-initial-example` directory.
It consists of two simple applications written in Go — a server and a client.
One should inspect the code and fully understand it before proceeding.

The `01-initial-example` directory also includes Kubernetes manifests that can
be used to deploy the client and the server. After inspecting the code carefully
one should run the following commands to deploy the application to the cluster.

Create the `kubernetes-vault-example-01` namespace:
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl create -f 01-initial-example/01-namespace.yaml
namespace "kubernetes-vault-example-01" created
----

Create the `time-server` stateful set and expose it as a service to the cluster:
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl create -f 01-initial-example/02-time-server.yaml
statefulset "time-server" created
service "time-server" created
----

Create the `time-client` stateful set.
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl create -f 01-initial-example/03-time-client.yaml
statefulset "time-client" created
----

At this point, inspecting pods in the `kubernetes-vault-example-01` namespace
will reveal two pods, as expected:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-01 get pod
NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
time-client-0   1/1       Running   0          8s
time-server-0   1/1       Running   0          12s
----

One may also inspect the server and client logs to make sure everythins is
working properly.

Fetch logs from the `time-server-0` pod in the `kubernetes-vault-example-01` namespace:
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-01 logs time-server-0
2017/11/13 08:49:58 got time request from 'time-client'
2017/11/13 08:50:03 got time request from 'time-client'
2017/11/13 08:50:08 got time request from 'time-client'
(...)
----

Above, one can see that a client named `time-client` is making periodic requests.

Now, fetch the logs from the `time-client-0` pod in the `kubernetes-vault-example-01` namespace:
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-01 logs time-client-0
2017/11/13 08:49:58 got time from server: 2017-11-13T08:49:58Z
2017/11/13 08:50:03 got time from server: 2017-11-13T08:50:03Z
2017/11/13 08:50:08 got time from server: 2017-11-13T08:50:08Z
(...)
----

One can observe the server is responding with the date and time.

The example works as expected, but inspecting the code quickly reveals a major
security issue. The credentials used for authentication are hardcoded in both
`server.go` and `client.go`:

[source,go]
----
const (
  Username = "time-client"
  Password = "safe#passw0rd!"
)
----

In order to solve this problem one will use Vault to securely store and distribute
the credentials as a secret and `kubernetes-vault-client` to inject this secret
into each pod.

== Using Secrets From Vault

=== Configuring and Provisioning Vault

In order to provision the credentials as a Vault secret, one should first
authenticate with Vault using the Vault root token:

[source,bash]
----
$ export VAULT_ADDR="https://vault.example.com"

$ vault auth
Token (will be hidden): <insert_root_token>
Successfully authenticated! You are now logged in.
token: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
token_duration: 0
token_policies: [root]
----

Then one may create the secret itself:

[source,bash]
----
$ vault write secret/time-server-credentials \
    username="time-client" \
    password="safe#passw0rd!"
Success! Data written to: secret/time-server-credentials
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
For security purposes, one must make sure this command doesn't end up in
the shell history.
====

[NOTE]
====
- The path to the secret is `secret/time-server-credentials`.
- The secret contains a key named `username` with value `time-client`.
- The secret contains a key named `password` with value `safe#passw0rd!`.
====

Once one has created the secret one can create a
https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies.html[policy] that will
control access to it:

[source,bash]
----
$ cat <<EOF > time-server-credentials-ro.hcl
path "secret/time-server-credentials" { # <1>
    capabilities = ["read"] # <1>
}
EOF
$ vault write sys/policy/time-server-credentials-ro \
    policy="@time-server-credentials-ro.hcl"
Success! Data written to: sys/policy/time-server-credentials-ro
----

The policy created above, named `time-server-credentials-ro`,
grants *_read-only_* access to the `secret/time-server-credentials` path.

Finally, one needs to create a role associated with this policy in the
`kubeauth` authentication backend:

[#role-time-server-credentials-reader]
[source,bash]
----
$ vault write auth/kubeauth/role/time-server-credentials-reader \
    bound_service_account_names="default" \
    bound_service_account_namespaces="kubernetes-vault-example-02" \
    policies="default,time-server-credentials-ro" \
    period="60s"
Success! Data written to: auth/kubeauth/role/time-server-credentials-reader
----

[NOTE]
====
- One must replace `kubeauth` with the path to the Kubernetes authentication backend.
- Only the `default` service account can authenticate with the `time-server-credentials-reader` role.
- Authentication is also only allowed in the `kubernetes-vault-example-02` namespace.
- The set of policies associated with this role are `default` and `time-server-credentials-ro`.
- Tokens issued by this role will have a TTL of one minute, being renewable indefinitely.
====

To make sure everything is in place, one may lookup the newly created policy and
role:

[source,bash]
----
$ vault policies time-server-credentials-ro
path "secret/time-server-credentials" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}

$ vault read auth/kubeauth/role/time-server-credentials-reader
Key                             	Value
---                             	-----
bound_service_account_names     	[default]
bound_service_account_namespaces	[kubernetes-vault-example-02]
max_ttl                         	0
num_uses                        	0
period                          	60
policies                        	[default time-server-credentials-ro]
ttl                             	0
----

At this point one is ready to start injecting Vault secrets into pods.

=== Using `kubernetes-vault-client`

[`kubernetes-vault-client`](https://github.com/travelaudience/kubernetes-vault-client) runs as an
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/[*_init container_*]
that authenticates with Vault and dumps secrets as files to a shared volume.

==== Refactoring the Code

The first step towards using secrets from Vault is to change the
existing code in order to read the credentials from the filesystem.

The updated code lives in the `02-using-secrets-from-vault` directory. One
should carefully analyze the changes made to the code before proceeding. The
most important change is the removal of:

[source,go]
----
const (
  Username = "time-client"
  Password = "safe#passw0rd!"
)
----

the introduction of the pathes where the credentials will be mounted:

[source,go]
----
const (
  PathToUsername = "/secret/username"
  PathToPassword = "/secret/password"
)
----

and last, read the credentials:

[source,go]
----
if val, err := ioutil.ReadFile(PathToUsername); err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("failed to read secret from %s: %v", PathToUsername, err)
} else {
	username = string(val)
}

if val, err := ioutil.ReadFile(PathToPassword); err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("failed to read secret from %s: %v", PathToPassword, err)
} else {
	password = string(val)
}
----

==== Updating the Kubernetes Manifests

With the code ready to read the secrets from the filesystem the only thing that
is missing is to bring in `kubernetes-vault-client`. To achieve this, one has to
perform two steps:

* Create the `ConfigMap` that `kubernetes-vault-client` will use to
  configure itself;
* Update the Kubernetes manifests in order to launch `kubernetes-vault-client` as an init container.

The contents of the `ConfigMap`, which can be found in
`02-using-secrets-from-vault/02-configmap.yaml`, should be similar to the
following:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  config.yaml: |
    address: https://vault.example.com
    auth:
      type: kubernetes
      backend: kubeauth
      data:
        role: time-server-credentials-reader
    mode:
      name: initC
      data:
        kv:
          - path: secret/time-server-credentials
            key: username
            mountPath: /secret/username
          - path: secret/time-server-credentials
            key: password
            mountPath: /secret/password
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-vault-client
  namespace: kubernetes-vault-example-02
----

[NOTE]
====
- One must replace `vault.example.com` with the domain where Vault can be reached.
- The type of authentication backend being used. This has the fixed value `kubernetes`.
- One must replace `kubeauth` with the actual path to the mount in Vault.
- The <<role-time-server-credentials-reader,role>> being requested by the application.
- Instruct `kubernetes-vault-client` to request the `username` key from
`secret/time-server-credentials` and dump it to `/secret/username`.
- Instruct `kubernetes-vault-client` to request the `password` key from
`secret/time-server-credentials` and dump it to `/secret/password`.
====

The changes required in the Kubernetes manifests consist of four items:

* Create a volume of type `configMap` referencing the `ConfigMap` created
  above.
* Create a volume of type `emptyDir` with spec `medium: Memory` that will act as
  a shared `tmpfs` volume between `kubernetes-vault-client` and the
  applications.
* Add `kubernetes-vault-client` as an init container.
* Mount the `configMap` and the `emptyDir` volumes in the init container, and
  mount the `emptyDir` volume in the application's container as well.

The final result can be seen at
`02-using-secrets-from-vault/03-time-server.yaml` and
`02-using-secrets-from-vault/04-time-client.yaml`. One should carefully analyze
the differences between these files and the ones in `01-initial-example` before
proceeding.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the Kubernetes cluster being used has
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/[RBAC] enabled one must
perform an extra step, which is to authorize the service account being used to
perform a _token review_. Since one is using the `default` service account in
the `kubernetes-vault-example-02` namespace, one must run

[source,bash]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-vault-example-02-tokenreview-binding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: system:auth-delegator
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: kubernetes-vault-example-02
EOF
----

In a real-world scenario every combination of service account and namespace in
use must have such a `ClusterRoleBinding` associated with it.
====

==== Running the Example

One is now ready to deploy the example:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl create -f 02-using-secrets-from-vault/01-namespace.yaml
namespace "kubernetes-vault-example-02" created

$ kubectl create -f 02-using-secrets-from-vault/02-configmap.yaml
configmap "kubernetes-vault-client" created

$ kubectl create -f 02-using-secrets-from-vault/03-time-server.yaml
statefulset "time-server" created
service "time-server" created

$ kubectl create -f 02-using-secrets-from-vault/04-time-client.yaml
statefulset "time-client" created
----

After running the command above one should inspect pods in the
`kubernetes-vault-example-02` namespace to make sure there are no errors:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-02 get pod
NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
time-client-0   1/1       Running   0          8s
time-server-0   1/1       Running   0          12s
----

If one's output is similar to the above it means that `kubernetes-vault-client`
ran successfully and dumped the secrets to a path where the applications can
reach them. To make sure this is the case one can inspect the logs of
`kubernetes-vault-client`:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-02 logs --container kubernetes-vault-client time-server-0
time="2017-11-13T08:56:13Z" level=info msg="vault: auth successful" token_accessor=d89bddbd-495a-7bda-df94-eadab700972f token_ttl_sec=60
time="2017-11-13T08:56:13Z" level=info msg="initC: dump successful"
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-02 logs --container kubernetes-vault-client time-client-0
time="2017-11-13T08:56:16Z" level=info msg="vault: auth successful" token_accessor=fea23820-b56a-56d4-0a74-8c03cf9df93e token_ttl_sec=60
time="2017-11-13T08:56:16Z" level=info msg="initC: dump successful"
----

One may also inspect each pod's filesystem to make extra sure the secrets have
been dumped:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-02 exec time-server-0 -- cat /secret/username
time-client
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-02 exec time-server-0 -- cat /secret/password
safe#passw0rd!
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-02 exec time-client-0 -- cat /secret/username
time-client
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-02 exec time-client-0 -- cat /secret/password
safe#passw0rd!
----

The application is a tiny bit more secure now. However, communication is still
made over plain HTTP. One will take care of setting-up TLS in the next section.

== Using Certificates from Vault

=== Configuring Vault

Most of the configuration needed to start issuing TLS certificates with Vault
has already been made when configuring the `root-ca` and `intermediate-ca`
secret backends. There are only two steps missing before one can start:

* To create *_roles_* that specify the properties of each issued certificate.
* To create *_policies_* that allows requests for certificates from the
  `intermediate-ca` backend, and to associate then with the `kubeauth` backend.

==== Creating the PKI roles

Since one want to establish mutual TLS authentication, one will need two roles —
one for the server and one for the client:

[source,bash]
----
$ ALLOWED_DOMAINS=(
    time-server.kubernetes-vault-example-03.svc.cluster.local
    time-server.kubernetes-vault-example-03
    time-server
)
$ vault write intermediate-ca/roles/time-server \
    allowed_domains=$(IFS=","; echo "${ALLOWED_DOMAINS[*]}") \
    allow_subdomains=false \
    allow_bare_domains=true \
    max_ttl=2160h \
    client_flag=false
----

[NOTE]
====
- The role's name is `time-server`.
- Turn `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` into a comma-separated list of domain names.
- Do not allow requests for subdomains.
- Allow requests for bare domains (i.e., domains matching those defined in
`ALLOWED_DOMAINS`).
- Make the issued certificates expire in 90 days.
- Do not set the client flag in issued certificates since these will be used
    for establishing TLS on the server.
====

[source,bash]
----
$ vault write intermediate-ca/roles/time-client \
    allowed_domains="time-client" \
    allow_subdomains="false" \
    allow_bare_domains="true" \
    max_ttl="2160h" \
    server_flag="false"
----

[NOTE]
====
- The role's name is `time-client`.
- The list of allowed domains is simply `time-client`.
- Do not allow requests for subdomains.
- Allow requests for bare domains (i.e., domains matching those defined in
`ALLOWED_DOMAINS`).
- Make the issued certificates expire in 90 days.
- Do not set the server flag in issued certificates since these will be used
for establishing TLS on the client.
====

To make extra-sure everything is set-up properly one may read the roles back
from Vault:

[source,bash]
----
$ vault read intermediate-ca/roles/time-server

ttl                    	0s
use_csr_common_name    	true
use_csr_sans           	true
----

If the output is similar to the above it is safe to proceed.

==== Creating the Policy and Authentication Roles

Create a policy named `time-server` that grants *_write_* access to the
`intermediate-ca/issue/time-server` path:

[source,bash]
----
$ cat <<EOF > time-server.hcl
path "intermediate-ca/issue/time-server" {
    capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}
EOF

$ vault write sys/policy/time-server \
    policy="@time-server.hcl"
Success! Data written to: sys/policy/time-server
----

Create a policy named `time-client` that grants *_write_* access to the
`intermediate-ca/issue/time-client` path:

[source,bash]
----
$ cat <<EOF > time-client.hcl
path "intermediate-ca/issue/time-client" {
    capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}
EOF

$ vault write sys/policy/time-client \
    policy="@time-client.hcl"
Success! Data written to: sys/policy/time-client
----

Once the policies have been created one can create the necessary roles in the
`kubeauth` authentication backend:

[source,bash]
----
$ vault write auth/kubeauth/role/time-server \
    bound_service_account_names="default" \
    bound_service_account_namespaces="kubernetes-vault-example-03" \
    policies="default,time-server" \
    period="60s"
Success! Data written to: auth/kubeauth/role/time-server
----

[NOTE]
====
- One must replace `kubeauth` with the path to the Kubernetes authentication
backend.
- Only the `default` service account can authenticate with this role.
- Authentication is also only allowed in the `kubernetes-vault-example-03`
namespace.
-The set of policies associated with this role are `default` and `time-server`.
- Tokens issued by this role will have a TTL of one minute, being renewable
indefinitely.
====

[source,bash]
----
$ vault write auth/kubeauth/role/time-client \
    bound_service_account_names="default" \
    bound_service_account_namespaces="kubernetes-vault-example-03" \
    policies="default,time-client" \
    period="60s"
Success! Data written to: auth/kubeauth/role/time-client
----

[NOTE]
====
- One must replace `kubeauth` with the path to the Kubernetes authentication
backend.
- Only the `default` service account can authenticate with this role.
- Authentication is also only allowed in the `kubernetes-vault-example-03`
namespace.
- The set of policies associated with this role are `default` and
`time-client`.
- Tokens issued by this role will have a TTL of one minute, being renewable
indefinitely.
====

At this point one is ready to start using `kubernetes-vault-client` to inject
certificates into pods.

=== Using `kubernetes-vault-client`

==== Refactoring the Code

The updated code lives in the `03-using-certificates-from-vault` directory. One
should carefully analyze the changes made to the code before proceeding. These
are a bit more complex than those made in the previous iteration, but mostly
involve setting up TLS and requiring certificate validation in both the client
and the server. Also, one should note that `time-server` now listens on port
`443` instead of port `80`.

==== Updating the Kubernetes Manifests

With the code ready to read certificates and private keys from the filesystem,
the only thing that is missing is to update the existing Kubernetes manifests.
One should carefully analyze the changes made to the manifests before
proceeding. The most notable changes are those in the `ConfigMap`, which now
looks like this:

[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  server.yaml: |
    address: https://vault.example.com
    auth:
      type: kubernetes
      backend: kubeauth
      data:
        role: time-server
    mode:
      name: initC
      data:
        pki:

[NOTE]
====
- Once mounted, the `server.yaml` file will contain the configuration for the
`kubernetes-vault-client` instance that will request certificates for `time-server`.
- Instead of requesting secrets from a `kv` backend like in the previous
iteration, one will now request certificates from a `pki` backend.
- The name of the `pki` backend from which one will request certificates.
- The name of the role in the `pki` backend corresponding to the desired
configuration.
- The *_common name_* (`CN`) one wants for the certificate.
- A list of *_subject alternative names_* one wants for the certificate.
- One should indicate that the `CN` being requested is not an identifier
(i.e., it is a domain name).
- One mounted, the `client.yaml` file will contain the configuration for the
`kubernetes-vault-client` instance that will request certificates for
`time-client`.
- In the case of `time-client` the `CN` being requested is actually an
identifier.
====

The final result can be seen at `03-using-secrets-from-vault`. One should
carefully analyze the differences between the manifests in this directory and
the ones in `02-using-secrets-from-vault` before proceeding.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the Kubernetes cluster being used has
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/[RBAC] enabled one must
perform an extra step, which is to authorize the service account being used to
perform a _token review_. Since one is using the `default` service account in
the `kubernetes-vault-example-03` namespace, one must run

[source,bash]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-vault-example-02-tokenreview-binding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: system:auth-delegator
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: kubernetes-vault-example-03
EOF
----

In a real-world scenario every combination of service account and namespace in
use must have such a `ClusterRoleBinding` associated with it.
====

==== Running the Example

One is now ready to deploy the example:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl create -f 03-using-certificates-from-vault/01-namespace.yaml
namespace "kubernetes-vault-example-02" created

$ kubectl create -f 03-using-certificates-from-vault/02-configmap.yaml
configmap "kubernetes-vault-client" created

$ kubectl create -f 03-using-certificates-from-vault/03-time-server.yaml
statefulset "time-server" created
service "time-server" created

$ kubectl create -f 03-using-certificates-from-vault/04-time-client.yaml
statefulset "time-client" created
----

After running the command above one should inspect pods in the
`kubernetes-vault-example-03` namespace to make sure there are no errors:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-03 get pod
NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
time-client-0   1/1       Running   0          8s
time-server-0   1/1       Running   0          12s
----

If one's output is similar to the above it means that `kubernetes-vault-client`
ran successfully and dumped the certificates to a path where the applications
can reach them. To make sure this is the case one can inspect the logs of
`kubernetes-vault-client`:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-03 logs --container kubernetes-vault-client time-server-0
time="2017-11-13T09:00:50Z" level=info msg="vault: auth successful" token_accessor=87b2df55-b032-2598-f05d-20baf04dc1af token_ttl_sec=60
time="2017-11-13T09:00:51Z" level=info msg="initC: dump successful"

$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-03 logs --container kubernetes-vault-client time-client-0
time="2017-11-13T09:00:54Z" level=info msg="vault: auth successful" token_accessor=5d636966-59f3-81ed-4382-8507b0428c3c token_ttl_sec=60
time="2017-11-13T09:00:54Z" level=info msg="initC: dump successful"
----

=== Inspecting Mutual TLS Authentication

To make extra-sure mutual TLS is working properly, one may make a few simple
tests against `time-server`. First, one should copy the certificates from the
`time-client-0` container into the local workstation:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-03 cp time-client-0:/secret/chain.pem ./chain.pem
tar: removing leading '/' from member names

$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-03 cp time-client-0:/secret/crt.pem ./crt.pem
tar: removing leading '/' from member names

$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-03 cp time-client-0:/secret/crt.pem ./key.pem
tar: removing leading '/' from member names
----

Then, one may verify the `crt.pem` certificate's authenticity according to the
`chain.pem` CA bundle:

[source,bash]
----
$ openssl verify -CAfile ./chain.pem -purpose sslclient ./crt.pem
./crt.pem: OK <1>
----
<1> The client certificate issued to `time-client-0` is valid.

One may also inspect the certificate itself:

[source,bash]
----
$ openssl x509 -in ./crt.pem -noout -text

<1> The _moduli_ do match, which means the private key is valid for the
    certificate.

Finally, one may want to make a "manual" request to `time-server`. To do that
one should first run the following commain *_in a separate terminal window_*:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl --namespace kubernetes-vault-example-03 port-forward time-server-0 8443:443
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8443 -> 443
----

Then, back to the original terminal window, one should first run

[source,bash]
----
$ curl https://localhost:8443/
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
 of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
 bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
 using the --cacert option.
If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
 the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
 problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
 not match the domain name in the URL).
If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
 the -k (or --insecure) option.
HTTPS-proxy has similar options --proxy-cacert and --proxy-insecure.
----

This means that `cURL` was unable to verify the authenticity of the server's
certificate. This is expected, because it is signed by a custom certificate
authority (the `intermediate-ca`). If one runs the command again but this time
telling `cURL` about one's certificate authority, the result will be slightly
different:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl --cacert ./chain.pem https://localhost:8443/
curl: (35) error:14094412:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:sslv3 alert bad certificate # <1>
----
<1> The actual error code may differ between systems.

In short, this means that `cURL` was able to validate the server's certificate
but the server was not provided with a client certificate — which means that
mutual TLS authentication is in fact in place. To be able to make a successful
request one must provide the client certificate and private key:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl --cacert ./chain.pem --cert ./crt.pem --key ./key.pem https://localhost:8443/
2017-11-12T16:11:21Z
----

One can easily see that this last request was successful, and that mutual TLS
authentication is indeed is place.
